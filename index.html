            <p>Introduction<br>The following advice is provided as a resource for UK healthcare professionals based on a combination of available evidence, good practice and expert advice.The priorities are:<br><br>The reduction of transmission of COVID-19 to pregnant women.<br><br>The provision of safe care to pregnant women with suspected/confirmed COVID-19.<br><br>Please be aware that this is very much an evolving situation and this guidance is a living document that is being updated as new information becomes available. We therefore suggest that you visit this page regularly for current advice.<br><br>SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus, and therefore the evidence currently available to guide clinical management in this specific situation is of low quality. Using a conventional grading system for guideline development, such as SIGN, many of the studies would be classed as level 3 or 4 (non-analytical studies e.g. case series/reports and expert opinion).1 The advice based on this evidence would therefore be graded D, and in some cases, graded as good practice points. Clinicians and patients are advised to be aware of the low quality evidence on which the advice is made, when using this guidance to assist decision-making. We are currently updating this guidance weekly in line with newly available evidence.<br><br>On Friday 20 March 2020, the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) launched a registry for all women admitted to UK hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. Further information can be found here.<br><br>This guidance will be kept under regular review as new evidence emerges. If you would like to suggest additional areas for this guidance to cover, any clarifications required or to submit new evidence for consideration, please email COVID-19@rcog.org.uk. Please note, we will not be able to give individual clinical advice or information for specific organisational requirements via this email address.<br>The virus<br>Novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) is a new strain of coronavirus causing COVID-19, first identified in Wuhan City, China. Other human coronavirus (HCoV) infections include HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1, which usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses like the common cold, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).<br><br><br><br>Epidemiology<br>The virus appears to have originated in Hubei province in China towards the end of 2019. Within Europe, Italy and Spain are the countries currently most affected. The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes a daily international situation report with an additional Situation Dashboard illustrating information by individual countries. The total number of confirmed cases in the UK is published by the Department of Health and Social Care, and is available in a visual dashboard.<br><br>This situation however is changing rapidly. For the most up-to-date advice please consult local health protection agencies. Health protection in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter and links to local guidance are available for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Public Health England (PHE) and Public Health Scotland (PHS) have been cited throughout this document; specific guidance from the other areas of the UK will be updated as they become available. At the time of writing, Public Health Wales are aligning with PHE on case definitions, assessment, infection prevention and control and testing. We will update the RCOG guidance if this changes.<br>Transmission<br>Most cases of COVID-19 globally have evidence of human to human transmission.This virus can be readily isolated from respiratory secretions, faeces and fomites.There are two routes by which COVID-19 can be spread.The first is directly through close contact with an infected person (within 2 metres) where respiratory secretions can enter the eyes, mouth, nose or airways.This risk increases the longer someone has close contact with an infected person who has symptoms.The second route is indirectly via the touching of a surface, object or the hand of an infected person contaminated with respiratory secretions and subsequently touching one&rsquo;s own mouth, nose or eyes. Healthcare providers are recommended to employ strict infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, as per local Health Protection guidance.<br><br>Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy itself alters the body&rsquo;s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally cause more severe symptoms.This will be the same for COVID-19.<br><br>With regard to vertical transmission (transmission from woman to her baby antenatally or intrapartum), emerging evidence now suggests that vertical transmission is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the significance to the neonate has yet to be determined.Two reports have published evidence of IgM for SARS-COV-2 in neonatal serum at birth.2,3 Since IgM does not cross the placenta, this is likely to<br><br><br><br><br>represent a neonatal immune response to in utero infection. Previous case reports from China suggested that there was no evidence for this and amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from COVID-19 infected women and their babies have so far all tested negative for the virus.4-7<br><br>The evidence above is all based on small numbers of cases.The situation may change and we will continue to monitor outcomes. MBRRACE-UK have recently commenced centralised, real-time monitoring of affected<br>women admitted to hospital, and their babies, through UKOSS.The data from these reports will be included in future versions of this guideline.<br>Effect on pregnant women<br>There is evolving evidence within the general population that there could be a cohort of asymptomatic individuals or those with very minor symptoms that are carrying the virus, although the incidence is unknown. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold/flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, headache and anosmia are other relevant symptoms.<br><br>It has long been known that, whilst pregnant women are not necessarily more susceptible to viral illness, changes to their immune system in pregnancy can be associated with more severe symptoms.This is particularly true towards the end of pregnancy.The absolute risks are, however, small.8 More severe symptoms such as pneumonia and marked hypoxia are widely described with COVID-19 in older people, the immunosuppressed and those with long-term conditions such as diabetes, cancer and chronic lung disease.9 These same severe symptoms could occur in pregnant women and so should be identified and treated promptly.<br><br>There have been case reports of women with severe COVID at the time of birth who have required ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.10 A single case report has been published in scientific literature of a maternal death and intrauterine fetal death at 30 weeks&rsquo; gestation.These deaths, which occurred in Iran, were directly attributed to COVID-19.11<br><br>Two cases series have recently been published by clinicians in New York.The first describes 43 women who tested positive for COVID-19 and showed a similar pattern of disease severity to non-pregnant adults: 86% mild, 9% severe and 5% critical, although the sample size was too small to draw a definitive conclusion and the comparison not made to age, sex or co-morbidity-matched individuals.12 The second describes the results of screening all 215 women who attended two paired maternity units for labour and birth over a 2 week period. Of these, 15.4% of women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from naso-pharyngeal swabs on attendance to the<br><br><br><br><br>hospital. Most were asymptomatic; only 4 (1.9%) had symptoms of COVID-19 on attendance and 3 others developed fever or possible symptoms during their inpatient stay. In the UK, the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre weekly report on individuals admitted to critical care with COVID-19 was updated on 10 April 2020, describing the first 3,883 patients admitted to critical care settings with a diagnosis of COVID-19, ten were pregnant and 13 recently pregnant (within the last six weeks).The rate of current/recent pregnancy amongst all individuals admitted to critical care (2.3%) remains similar to the reported rate for non-COVID viral pneumonia during 2017-19 (3.3%), although the number of people admitted is higher for all groups.13 Other reported cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy are milder and with good recovery.14<br><br>Individual responses to viral infection are different for different pregnant women and for different viruses. However, influenza and pregnancy provides a useful comparator: data from Australia, examining critical illness in pregnancy and the postpartum period due to the infection H1N1, identified significant increases in critical illness in later pregnancy, compared with early pregnancy.15 In other types of coronavirus infection (SARS,<br>MERS), the risks to pregnant women appear to increase in particular during the last trimester of pregnancy. In at least one study, there was an increased risk of preterm birth being indicated for maternal medical reasons after 28 weeks&rsquo; gestation.16<br><br>Given that pregnancy is known to be a hypercoagulable state, and emerging evidence suggests that individuals admitted to hospital with COVID-19 are also hypercoagulable,17 it follows that infection with COVID-19 is likely to be associated with an increased risk of maternal venous-thromboembolism.18 Reduced mobility resulting from self-isolation at home, or hospital admission, is likely to increase the risk further.<br>Effect on the fetus<br>There are currently no data suggesting an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to COVID-19. Case reports from early pregnancy studies with SARS and MERS do not demonstrate a convincing relationship between infection and increased risk of miscarriage or second trimester loss.19<br><br>There is no evidence currently that the virus is teratogenic.Very recent evidence has, however, suggested that it is probable that the virus can be vertically transmitted, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the significance to the neonate has yet to be determined.2.3<br><br>There are case reports of preterm birth in women with COVID-19, but it is unclear whether this was iatrogenic in every case, or whether some were spontaneous. Iatrogenic birth was predominantly for maternal indications related to the viral infection, although there was evidence of fetal compromise and prelabour preterm rupture of the membranes in at least one report.4.20<br><br><br></p>
